# VictoriaMetrics + VictoriaLogs Dummy Project
<img width="2804" height="1622" alt="ArchitectureDiagram" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dc62c5d-b494-44e5-b26c-315df8b99058" />


This is a **learning project** to practice setting up and using:

- VictoriaMetrics
- VictoriaLogs
- VictoriaTraces
- OpenTelemetry
- Grafana
- AWS S3 (log archival)
- Terraform (AWS infrastructure provisioning)
- Golang (for instrumented demo app)

The goal is to understand how metrics, logs, and traces flow through a modern observability stack, how to visualize/query them in Grafana, and how to archive logs long-term to S3.

## What this project is for

- Learn how to run a local observability stack with Docker Compose.
- Learn how OpenTelemetry can collect/forward telemetry (metrics, logs, and traces).
- Learn how VictoriaMetrics stores and serves time-series metrics.
- Learn how VictoriaLogs stores and serves logs.
- Learn how VictoriaTraces stores and serves distributed traces.
- Learn how Grafana connects to all three backends for dashboards and exploration.
- Learn how to archive logs long-term to AWS S3 with time-based partitioning.
- Learn how to provision cloud infrastructure (S3 bucket, IAM) with Terraform.

## Tech Stack

- **VictoriaMetrics** (`victoriametrics/victoria-metrics`)
- **VictoriaLogs** (`victoriametrics/victoria-logs`)
- **VictoriaTraces** (`victoriametrics/victoria-traces`)
- **OpenTelemetry Collector** (`otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib`)
- **Grafana** (`grafana/grafana`)
- **AWS S3** (long-term log archival via OTel Collector `awss3` exporter)
- **Golang** (to produce sample app telemetry)

## Architecture (high level)

1. A Golang app emits metrics/logs/traces via the OpenTelemetry SDK.
2. OpenTelemetry Collector receives telemetry on OTLP HTTP (`4318`).
3. Metrics are exported to VictoriaMetrics; traces to VictoriaTraces.
4. Logs are exported to **both** VictoriaLogs (hot/queryable) and **AWS S3** (cold archival, partitioned by `YYYY/MM/DD/HH/MM`).
5. Grafana reads from VictoriaMetrics, VictoriaLogs, and VictoriaTraces for dashboards and queries.

## Services and Ports

From `compose.yml`:

- **VictoriaMetrics**: `http://localhost:8428`
- **VictoriaLogs**: `http://localhost:9201`
- **Grafana**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **OpenTelemetry Collector (OTLP HTTP)**: `http://localhost:4318`

> Current retention in this setup is `2d` for VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs.

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- AWS account with credentials that have permissions to provision S3 and IAM resources
- Terraform installed (to provision the S3 bucket and IAM resources in `terraform/`)
- A `.env` file in the project root with your AWS credentials (see Getting Started)
- (Optional) Go installed locally if you want to run a sample app outside containers

## Getting Started

1. Provision AWS infrastructure with Terraform:

	```bash
	cd terraform
	terraform init
	terraform apply
	```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your AWS credentials:

	```bash
	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
	AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
	```

	> The OTel Collector uses these to authenticate the `awss3` log exporter.

3. Start the stack:

	```bash
	docker compose up -d
	```

4. Check running services:

	```bash
	docker compose ps
	```

5. Open Grafana:

	- URL: `http://localhost:3000`
	- Default credentials (unless changed): `admin` / `admin`

6. Stop the stack when done:

	```bash
	docker compose down
	```

## Useful Commands

View all logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

View a single service logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f victoria-metrics
docker compose logs -f victoria-logs
docker compose logs -f opentelemetry
docker compose logs -f grafana
```

Reset all persisted data (destructive):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Suggested Learning Path

1. Provision AWS infrastructure with Terraform (`terraform/`).
2. Bring up the stack and verify all services are healthy.
3. Send sample telemetry from the Go app using OpenTelemetry.
4. Confirm data ingestion in VictoriaMetrics, VictoriaLogs, and VictoriaTraces.
5. Explore data in Grafana (dashboards + query editors).
6. Verify logs are being archived in the S3 bucket under `logs/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/MM`.
7. Tune retention and collector pipelines to understand trade-offs.

## Notes

- This is intentionally a **dummy/non-production** setup.
- Defaults are kept simple for learning and quick iteration.
- For production, add auth, TLS, backup strategy, and hardened configs.
